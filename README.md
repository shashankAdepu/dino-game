# dino-game
This is an Arduino based project.
<h4>Equipments used</h4>
<li>Arduino board</li>
<li>Arduino IDE</li>
<li>LDR sensors</li>
<li>servo motor</li>
<p>Aim is automate the dino game.So, when the cactus comes the dino should jump.</p>
<p>One LDR sensor measures the background light intensity and give us the input.</p>
<p>Other two LDR sensor detects the cactus and cactus and gives the intensity.</p>
<p>Based on the inputs from the LDR sensors we give input to the servo to rotate So,that it presses the spacebar, thus the dino jumps and the game goes on.</p>
